## Master-Slave System : Lucas Square Pyramid
An interesting problem in arithmetic with deep implications for elliptic curve theory is the problem of finding perfect squares that are sums of consecutive squares. A classic example is the Pythagorean identity:
3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
That reveals that the sum of squares of 3, 4 is itself a square. A more interesting example is Lucasâ€˜ Square Pyramid :
1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 24^2 = 70^2
In both these examples, sums of squares of consecutive integers from the square of another integer. The goal of this project is to use Pony and the actor model to build a good solution to this problem that runs well on multi-core machines.

Task: Given n, k, find sequences of k consecutive numbers s1, s2, s3,.......sk in the range(1, n), such that s1^2 + s2^2 + s3^2 + .....+ sk^2 = S^2 where S is a Natural Number.

# Code:
This is an _Asynchronised_ Multi-Actor model that employs _Parallelism_.
The Main actor is the snippet where the actors return after they are done. Here, we initialize
> num_actors = n/(2*k) + 1.
> chunk_size _(size of Work Unit)_ = (n+k)/num_actors
We assign each chunk_size to each actor to scan for a sequence in that particular chunk. We initialize two iterators _start_ and _finish_ to determine the size of each work unit for an actor and keep track of actors that finished using __pending_actors_.
> start = finish + (2 - k)
> finish = (start + chunk_size + k)
> _pending_actors = num_actors
```
let _env: Env
  var _pending_actors: U128 = 0

  new create(env: Env) =>
    _env = env
    try
      let n = _env.args(1)?.usize()?.u128()
      let k = _env.args(2)?.usize()?.u128()
      let num_actors: U128 = (n/(2*k)) + 1 // Divide the task among actors
      let chunk_size: U128 = (n+k)/num_actors

      _pending_actors = num_actors

      var start : U128 = 1
      var finish : U128 = start + chunk_size
      var i: U128 = 1
      while(i <= num_actors) do
        Luca(this, start, finish, k, env)
        start = finish + (2 - k)
        finish = (start + chunk_size + k)
        i = (i + 1)
    end
    else
      _env.out.print("Please enter valid numbers")

    _pending_actors = _pending_actors - 1
